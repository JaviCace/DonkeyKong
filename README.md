# Donkey Kong 

# Who are we
I am a student of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and this is a project for the subject Programacion de videoJuegos de Lenguajes Interpretados.

# Genre and General Vision
Arcade platform game inspired by the original Donkey Kong with added elements from the Super Mario Bros universe, including enemies like Boos and Koopas, and the use of vines for movement dynamics. The game is designed to provide a nostalgic yet fresh challenge for fans of classic platformers.

# Synopsis: 
The princess of the mushroom kingdom has been taken hostage by The Mighty DonKey Kong as a way of gaining control over her kingdom. Now, you, a short and fatty plumber , have been charged with the mission of saving her, even though there are probably loads of better knights to save her.

# Objective
The player must dodge enemies and obstacles while ascending platforms to reach Donkey Kong and rescue the princess. Completing all levels results in winning the game.

# Controls
You can move right and left using A and D respectively, SPACE to jump and to grab vines when you are next to them. You can also go up and down the ladders using W and S. Lastly you can use E to use the different weapons you grab.


# Style
The art is a Pixelart Style like the original game, with music and sounds that reminds of the old arcade music and melody


# Game Flow 
Once you start the game it will take you to a map where you can choose your level.
A lot like this type of map but in a 2D style, where the character can walk from level to level. 
Then, each level will consist of a series of platforms with different obstacles and enemies. And on top Donkey Kong throwing barrels at you. The player will have to go up the platforms and reach donkey kong, while dodging obstacles, enemies and barrels, if a flower or a hammer spawns, the player can pick it and use it to defeat enemies. Once the player reaches the top, either he goes to the next level or he wins the game. 


# Level Design
The game will have three levels. Each level will have a series of platforms and ladders that the player will have to climb to reach the platform where Donkey Kong and the princess are. Additionally, on some platforms, there will be a chance that a hammer will appear to help you, and depending on the level, the number of obstacles may vary. To make the game a little different from the original Donkey Kong, in addition to the original obstacles like the rolling barrel, the flaming barrel that falls in a straight line, and the fireball that moves from right to left, I will also add elements from the Mario Bros. saga, also from Nintendo, such as the Boos, who cannot be defeated by the hammer, the ice flower, vines, and skeleton enemies that revive for a while after being defeated. The first level will have the same mechanics as the regular game, plus the ghost, which teaches you that he cannot be killed. The second level contains vines, ice flowers that can kill Boos, and skeleton Koopas. The third level contains the boss battle, which will contain both levels, requiring players to reach a higher altitude.

# Hud/UI
The Hud consists of a timer in the top center of the level, the punctuation on the left top corner, and the lives in the right top corner.

# Score and Lives
The punctuation on the left top corner, which will start at 0 and will increase 200 per enemy defeated and 100 per item picked then 10 times the remaining time. He has 3 lives which he will lose after being hit. 


# Dynamics
Various dynamics are present in the game, first one the vines, when you use one of them you will be able to jump over wider gaps and give you momentum to move faster for a while. Another dynamic will be the different uses of the weapons, when you are using the hammer you can kill the fireballs and the skeleton koopas, but the boos will pass through, which will make you have to dodge them instead of attacking them. On the other hand the ice flower allows you to kill the koopas and the boos, but the fireballs won't die from them since they evaporate the ice. With both weapons the koopas will come back to life after a short time, making you have to pay attention to them so that you don't get trapped by too many enemies.  


# Mechanics
The mechanics of this game are pretty simple,the player can move left and right, up and down when he is next to a ladder.The player will be able to jump and grab onto vines to propel himself into bigger jumps. Another mechanic will be grabbing and using weapons.Lastly there will be the mechanics of points and time. The player will only have a set amount of time to win or they loose the game. The point system will grant you points depending on the time remaining, each enemy killed, each weapon picked, barrel destroyed and a fixed number of points if you win.


# Enemies
### FireBall: 
They will move left and right always in your direction without changing platforms , they can be killed using the hammer. 


### Skeleton koopa: 
They will move left and right without changing platforms , they can be killed using the hammer or the ice flower. Once dead they will revive after a while.


### Boos : 
They will float,following you at a slow pace, they can only die by the ice flower, otherwise they will continue following you till you die or win.



### Donkey Kong: 
He is in the top and wont move from there. He has two attacks: the first one being a rolling barrel that rolls down all the platforms and the second attack is a falling barrel, he throws in the direction you had and when it hits platforms he changes slightly direction. Once you reach the top he dies.
